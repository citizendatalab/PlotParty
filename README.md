# Plot Party: Participatory mapping installations

How to bring together the expertise of many people in a collaboratively produced visualisation? A plot party is an engaging way to gather information and personal views people. A plot party is one or a series of collaborative visual interventions that can be used to elicit responses about certain issues, to formulate (better) research questions, gather opinions and start a discussion, or identify priorities around a specific topic. We have done plot parties with groups of 3 and big events up to 300 people.
